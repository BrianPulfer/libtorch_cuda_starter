# VSCode LibTorch C++ CUDA Starter Project with Debugging

This is a starter project for using LibTorch with C++ and CUDA in VSCode for Linux systems using CMake (>=3.10).

## Requirements:
- Linux operating system
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

## Set-up:
- Download [LibTorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html)
- Extract `libtorch/` into the root of this project. If you'd like to use a system-wide installation, you can set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the path of the installation.

## Usage:
In VSCode, Simply set a breakpoint and hit `F5` to build and debug the project.
